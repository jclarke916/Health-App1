    "3 tbsp Guyanese Curry Powder (e.g., Chief or Lalah's)",

    "Cook brown rice separately (batch cook for the week if possible).",
    "Heat EVOO in a heavy pot on medium. Add remaining curry powder and masala and 'burn' (toast) for 1-2 mins until fragrant.",
    "Add onions and hot pepper, sauté until soft.",
    "Add marinated chicken to the pot, stir to coat in the curry paste, and let it brown.",

  why: "The spice blend is a polyphenol powerhouse. 'Burning' the curry in EVOO activates the fat-soluble curcumin, drastically reducing systemic inflammation (crucial for ANA 1:320). Brown rice adds resistant starch and soluble fiber, which binds to bile acids in the gut to drive down ApoB.",
